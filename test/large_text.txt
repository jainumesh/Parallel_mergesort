The 2022 United States House of Representatives elections will be held on November 8, 2022. Elections will be held to elect representatives from all 435 congressional districts across each of the 50 U.S. states, as well as five non-voting delegates from the District of Columbia and four of the five inhabited U.S. territories. Numerous other federal, state, and local elections, including the 2022 Senate elections, will also be held on this date. The winners of this election will serve in the 118th United States Congress, with seats apportioned among the states based on the 2020 United States census. Democrats have held a majority in the House of Representatives since January 3, 2019, as a result of the 2018 elections, when they won 235 seats. However, their majority was reduced to 222 seats in the 2020 elections.

Reapportionment
See also: 2020 United States redistricting cycle, United States congressional apportionment, and Redistricting in the United States
The 2020 United States census determined how many of the 435 congressional districts each state receives for the 2020 redistricting cycle. Due to population shifts, California, Illinois, Michigan, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia will lose one seat. Conversely, Colorado, Florida, Montana, North Carolina, and Oregon will gain one seat; and Texas will gain two seats.[44]

Newly created seats
Six new districts will be created and two districts will be restored after the 2020 redistricting process:

Colorado 8
Florida 28
Montana 1
Montana 2
North Carolina 14
Oregon 6
Texas 37
Texas 38
Seats to be eliminated
The following districts will be eliminated and become obsolete:

California 53
Illinois 18
Michigan 14
Montana at-large
New York 27
Ohio 16
Pennsylvania 18
West Virginia 3
Seats with multiple incumbents running
The following districts have multiple incumbent representatives running, a product of redistricting merging multiple districts.

Georgia 7: Carolyn Bourdeaux (D) and Lucy McBath (D)[45]
Illinois 6: Sean Casten (D) and Marie Newman (D)[46]
Illinois 15: Rodney Davis (R) and Mary Miller (R)[47]

The 2022 United States House of Representatives elections will be held on November 8, 2022. Elections will be held to elect representatives from all 435 congressional districts across each of the 50 U.S. states, as well as five non-voting delegates from the District of Columbia and four of the five inhabited U.S. territories. Numerous other federal, state, and local elections, including the 2022 Senate elections, will also be held on this date. The winners of this election will serve in the 118th United States Congress, with seats apportioned among the states based on the 2020 United States census. Democrats have held a majority in the House of Representatives since January 3, 2019, as a result of the 2018 elections, when they won 235 seats. However, their majority was reduced to 222 seats in the 2020 elections.

Reapportionment
See also: 2020 United States redistricting cycle, United States congressional apportionment, and Redistricting in the United States
The 2020 United States census determined how many of the 435 congressional districts each state receives for the 2020 redistricting cycle. Due to population shifts, California, Illinois, Michigan, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia will lose one seat. Conversely, Colorado, Florida, Montana, North Carolina, and Oregon will gain one seat; and Texas will gain two seats.[44]

Newly created seats
Six new districts will be created and two districts will be restored after the 2020 redistricting process:

Colorado 8
Florida 28
Montana 1
Montana 2
North Carolina 14
Oregon 6
Texas 37
Texas 38
Seats to be eliminated
The following districts will be eliminated and become obsolete:

California 53
Illinois 18
Michigan 14
Montana at-large
New York 27
Ohio 16
Pennsylvania 18
West Virginia 3
Seats with multiple incumbents running
The following districts have multiple incumbent representatives running, a product of redistricting merging multiple districts.

Georgia 7: Carolyn Bourdeaux (D) and Lucy McBath (D)[45]
Illinois 6: Sean Casten (D) and Marie Newman (D)[46]
Illinois 15: Rodney Davis (R) and Mary Miller (R)[47]
Michigan 11: Andy Levin (D) and Haley Stevens (D)[48]
North Carolina 11: Virginia Foxx (R) and Kathy Manning (D)[49]

The 2022 United States House of Representatives elections will be held on November 8, 2022. Elections will be held to elect representatives from all 435 congressional districts across each of the 50 U.S. states, as well as five non-voting delegates from the District of Columbia and four of the five inhabited U.S. territories. Numerous other federal, state, and local elections, including the 2022 Senate elections, will also be held on this date. The winners of this election will serve in the 118th United States Congress, with seats apportioned among the states based on the 2020 United States census. Democrats have held a majority in the House of Representatives since January 3, 2019, as a result of the 2018 elections, when they won 235 seats. However, their majority was reduced to 222 seats in the 2020 elections.

Reapportionment
See also: 2020 United States redistricting cycle, United States congressional apportionment, and Redistricting in the United States
The 2020 United States census determined how many of the 435 congressional districts each state receives for the 2020 redistricting cycle. Due to population shifts, California, Illinois, Michigan, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia will lose one seat. Conversely, Colorado, Florida, Montana, North Carolina, and Oregon will gain one seat; and Texas will gain two seats.[44]

Newly created seats
Six new districts will be created and two districts will be restored after the 2020 redistricting process:

Colorado 8
Florida 28
Montana 1
Montana 2
North Carolina 14
Oregon 6
Texas 37
Texas 38
Seats to be eliminated
The following districts will be eliminated and become obsolete:

California 53
Illinois 18
Michigan 14
Montana at-large
New York 27
Ohio 16
Pennsylvania 18
West Virginia 3
Seats with multiple incumbents running
The following districts have multiple incumbent representatives running, a product of redistricting merging multiple districts.

Georgia 7: Carolyn Bourdeaux (D) and Lucy McBath (D)[45]
Illinois 6: Sean Casten (D) and Marie Newman (D)[46]
Illinois 15: Rodney Davis (R) and Mary Miller (R)[47]

The 2022 United States House of Representatives elections will be held on November 8, 2022. Elections will be held to elect representatives from all 435 congressional districts across each of the 50 U.S. states, as well as five non-voting delegates from the District of Columbia and four of the five inhabited U.S. territories. Numerous other federal, state, and local elections, including the 2022 Senate elections, will also be held on this date. The winners of this election will serve in the 118th United States Congress, with seats apportioned among the states based on the 2020 United States census. Democrats have held a majority in the House of Representatives since January 3, 2019, as a result of the 2018 elections, when they won 235 seats. However, their majority was reduced to 222 seats in the 2020 elections.

Due to population shifts, California, Illinois, Michigan, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia will lose one seat. Conversely, Colorado, Florida, Montana, North Carolina, and Oregon will gain one seat; and Texas will gain two seats.[44]

Six new districts will be created and two districts will be restored after the 2020 redistricting process:

The 2022 United States House of Representatives elections will be held on November 8, 2022. Elections will be held to elect representatives from all 435 congressional districts across each of the 50 U.S. states, as well as five non-voting delegates from the District of Columbia and four of the five inhabited U.S. territories. Numerous other federal, state, and local elections, including the 2022 Senate elections, will also be held on this date. The winners of this election will serve in the 118th United States Congress, with seats apportioned among the states based on the 2020 United States census. Democrats have held a majority in the House of Representatives since January 3, 2019, as a result of the 2018 elections, when they won 235 seats. However, their majority was reduced to 222 seats in the 2020 elections.

Due to population shifts, California, Illinois, Michigan, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia will lose one seat. Conversely, Colorado, Florida, Montana, North Carolina, and Oregon will gain one seat; and Texas will gain two seats.[44]
